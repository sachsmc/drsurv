\description{
Doubly robust estimation of the survival probabilities in two exposure groups
and their difference using the method of Wang (2018). By default it is
assumed that censoring is completely independent, but covariate-dependence
can be modeled by either specifying the right side of \code{cformula} and \code{cens.method} which
will be passed to \link[eventglm]{cumincglm}.

\details{
As presented in Wang 2018, let the jackknife pseudo observation for the $i$th
subject be \deqn{\hat{S}^i(t) = n \hat{S}(t) - (n - 1)\hat{S}^{-i}(t),} where
\eqn{\hat{S}(t)} is an estimator of the survival probability at time \eqn{t}
using all \eqn{n} subjects, and \eqn{\hat{S}^{-i}(t)} is an estimator of the
survival probability at time \eqn{t} leaving the \eqn{i}th subject out of the
estimation procedure. The assumption about censoring is implied by the way
these pseudo observations are computed, i.e., these could be inverse
probability of censoring weighted estimators where the censoring distribution
may depend on covariates, nonparametric estimators stratified on covariates,
or simply the Kaplan-Meier estimators if censoring is assumed to be
independent of covariates. We then use a working outcome model for the
conditional survival probability:
\deqn{\log[-\log\{v_i(X_i)\}]=\log[-\log\{p(T > t | X_i, \boldsymbol{Z}_i)\}] =
\beta^\star X_i+h(X_i,\boldsymbol{Z}_i;\boldsymbol{\gamma}^\star),} where
\eqn{\log(-\log(x))} is the link function that coincides with how a
proportional hazards model fits survival at this time point. It is of note
that, unlike the Cox model, this estimator does not assume anything about the
survival function prior to time point \eqn{t}. The parameters in the above
model are estimated by solving the generalized estimating equations with
\eqn{\hat{S}^i(t)} used as the
outcome variable. Let \eqn{\hat{v}_i(x) = \exp[-\exp\{\hat{\beta}^\star
x+h(x,\boldsymbol{Z}_i;\hat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}^\star)\}]}. A logistic regression model for the propensity of the exposure is assumed and estimated. The doubly robust
estimator of the difference in survival probability at time \eqn{t} is
\deqn{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n\left[ \frac{X_i \hat{S}^i(t) - (X_i -
g(\boldsymbol{Z}_i,
\hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}))\hat{v}_i(1)}{g(\boldsymbol{Z}_i,
\hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})} - \frac{(1 - X_i) \hat{S}^i(t) + (X_i -
g(\boldsymbol{Z}_i, \hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}))\hat{v}_i(0)}{1 -
g(\boldsymbol{Z}_i, \hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})}\right].} Although Wang
proposed a variance estimator, it was found to be biased upward, and they
suggest instead using bootstrap variance estimation. Thus, we implement the
bootstrap variance estimator.
